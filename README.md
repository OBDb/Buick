# Buick

This repository serves as a default fallback for signal set configurations when a specific Buick model does not have its own dedicated signal set definitions. Rather than duplicating common signals across multiple repositories, this provides a baseline set of definitions applicable to many Buick vehicles.

## About Buick

Buick is one of America's oldest automotive brands, known for its commitment to premium comfort, refined performance, and innovative technology. Founded in 1899, Buick has consistently positioned itself between mainstream and luxury segments, offering attainable premium vehicles.

## Company History

- **Early Years (1899-1920s)**: Founded by David Dunbar Buick in Detroit as the Buick Motor Company, the brand quickly gained recognition for innovation and reliability. In 1908, Buick became a founding cornerstone of General Motors when William C. Durant formed the corporation.

- **Golden Age (1930s-1950s)**: Buick rose to prominence with landmarks like the Y-Job concept car (1938), considered the industry's first concept car, and introduction of the Dynaflow automatic transmission (1948). The brand established itself as a symbol of American success and aspiration.

- **Performance Era (1960s-1970s)**: Buick embraced performance with models like the Gran Sport (GS) and the Riviera, competing in the muscle car era while maintaining its luxury positioning. The brand pioneered technologies including the turbocharged V6 engine.

- **Modernization Period (1980s-2000s)**: Buick adapted to changing markets with front-wheel drive platforms, fuel-efficient powertrains, and advanced luxury features. Models like the Park Avenue and LeSabre remained popular premium choices.

- **Contemporary Era (2010s-present)**: Buick has reinvented itself with a modern lineup focusing on SUVs and crossovers like the Enclave, Encore, and Envision. The brand has become GM's primary luxury/premium offering in China while maintaining its North American presence with refined, technology-rich vehicles.
